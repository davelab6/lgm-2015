http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2015/program/##peter-sikking-metapolator:-designing-interaction-for-creative-pros:

> As a result of the 2014 LGM the Metapolator project got really going and I got involved, designing all its interaction. This talk shows how the interaction design was structured, the collaboration, research involving font designers, and what goes into designing for creatives.
>
> "Peter Sikking is very well known in Libre Graphics circles for his work on GIMP and his presentations at previous LGMs. An interaction designer for more than 20 years, he is specialised in designing interaction for creative pros."

http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2015/program/##markus-mohrhard-opengl-in-libreoffice:

> LibreOffice uses its own GUI and rendering toolkit called VCL that works across every major PC platform and even a few mobile platforms. On Linux it provides backends for Gtk and Qt. To make use of modern graphics hardware the LibreOffice project decided to add a cross-platform backend that still provides support for different GUI toolkits. 
>
> Using OpenGL allows us to improve the performance of our rendering by moving the work from the CPU to the mostly unused GPU. It also provides us with fast image scaling allowing us to use better scaling algorithms while still supporting fast scrolling. Together with the fact that OpenGL allows us to innovate without being limited by the ancient rendering APIs provided by different systems, makes porting our rendering toolkit to OpenGL an attractive option. 
>
> Come and see how the LibreOffice embraced this challenge and implemented the new VCL OpenGL backend that is being shipped in LibreOffice 4.4.
>
> _Markus is studying Mathematics at the Karlsruhe Institue for Techonoology and works part time on LibreOffice for Collabora. He mainly concentrates on LibreOffice calc and charts and in recent times the OpenGL support. He also maintains the LibreOffice cppunit version and is a co-maintainer of mdds, ixion and orcus. In his free time he likes to travel and see interesting new places._

http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2015/program/##Øyvind-kolås-microraptor-gui,-an-immediate-compromise:

> Introducting Microraptor gui, a framework/approach for creating graphical user interfaces, that interleaves registering event callbacks with procedural drawing code backed by CSS. This gives some efficiency and flexibility not found in traditional scene-graph/widget hierarchy approaches; flexibility useful for custom canvases/controls in graphical applications. Demo and code heavy presentation, live coding of UIs with C, cairo and CSS.
>
> _Øyvind Kolås has experimented with writing digital media tools and UIs with for a couple of decades, some of his results have found use in different libre graphics libraries and applications. He is investigating new approaches to model, combine and interact with digital media._

> The Document Liberation Project -- launched during the LGM2014 -- has already developed a dozen of import libraries which have been integrated by software such as: Abiword, Calligra, CorelDRAW File Viewer, Inkscape, LibreOffice and Scribus. The presentation gives overview of the achievement of the first year of this project
>
> Fridrich Strba is double national of Switzerland and Slovakia, Free Software enthusiast and evangelist. A founding member of the Document Liberation Project, he worked in the code base of LibreOffice during years. His favourite activity is writing of import filters for various undocumented file-formats. Currently he works for SUSE at SUSE Linux Enterprise. Fridrich continues to dedicate his time to free proprietary documents from vendor lock in. Mr. Strba is also a polyglot.
